That's about half the distance from the Earth to the moon and the closest approach the asteroid has made in nearly 300 years, EarthSky.org reported.\n","The space rock, known as 2010 WC9, was moving at almost 29,000 miles per hour as it passed. It has a diameter of 60 to 134 meters, or roughly 200 to 400 feet — \"as big across as a city block,\" Dr. Erin Ryan, an asteroid expert at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, told NBC News MACH in an email.\n","Big as it is, the asteroid was too faint to be seen with the naked eye even during the flyby. But Northolt Branch Observatories, an astronomy group in London, England, livestreamed telescopic views of the asteroid on its Facebook page in the days leading up to the flyby.\n","The first time Northolt Branch Observatories observed 2010 WC9 was on May 9, when it was still known by its provisional designation ZJ99C60 (and thought to be a \"new\" asteroid).

If it were made of rocky material, Ryan said, it might create a small crater and shatter windows — as happened in 2013, when a meteor entering the atmosphere blew up over Chelyabinsk, Russia.

Only the Saints and Browns join Denver in that ignominious category.\n","Elway's best pick since assuming more power was CB Bradley Roby at No. 31 in 2014. But his other top selections include Sylvester Williams, Shane Ray, Paxton Lynch and Garett Bolles. His second-round record is even spottier: Montee Ball, Cody Latimer, Ty Sambrailo, Adam Gotsis and DeMarcus Walker.\n","Center Matt Paradis, a sixth-round gem in 2014, is just about his only bargain in Elway's past five drafts.\n","A bounce-back season in 2018 might very well come down to Elway having a draft as he did with Xanders in 2011, when they teamed up to pick Miller, Rahim Moore, Orlando Franklin, Nate Irving, Julius Thomas and Virgil Green.\n","___\n","For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n","___\n","Follow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http:// This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.

But Toronto finished last in the 13-team league with a 6-17-7 record in its inaugural 2007 season. Ten years later and eight coaches later, it is MLS champion.\n","While soccer spans the globe, it can be a small world.\n","Johnston, whose off-field efforts as salesman for the fledgling Toronto franchise should not be forgotten, had perhaps already done a solid for TFC before signing on. In January 2006, as coach of the then-MetroStars, Johnston took a teenage forward named Jozy Altidore in the second round of the MLS SuperDraft.\n","Altidore, who chose to wear No. 17 to reflect where he went in the draft, scored 15 goals in 37 regular-season games for the renamed New York Red Bulls before leaving for Europe in 2008.\n","The U.S. international returned to MLS in 2015, becoming a major piece in the TFC puzzle. On Saturday, Altidore was named man of the match in Toronto’s 2-0 MLS Cup final win over Seattle.\n","Altidore has scored 45 goals in 86 regular-season and playoff games for Toronto. His last two were game-winners in the Eastern Conference final and MLS Cup final.\n","The MetroStars fired Johnston on June 27, 2006. He was introduced as Toronto’s coach less than two months later.\n","The 2006 draft had more Toronto connections.\n","Chivas USA coach Bob Bradley, father of current TFC captain Michael Bradley, traded the No. 1 pick to the MetroStars in return for the No. 5 selection and defender Jason Hernandez (a Toronto FC player today).\n","The MetroStars used that first pick to take defender Marvell Wynne, who would play 67 games for Toronto.\n","Bob Bradley, whom Johnston succeeded after he was fired by the MetroStars in October 2005, did more than OK in the 2006 draft. He used the fifth pick to take future U.S. international midfielder Sacha Kljestan.\n","Kljestan scored in a 2-0 win as Chivas spoiled Toronto’s MLS debut on April 7, 2007. Chivas was coached by Predrag (Preki) Radosavljevic, who succeeded Bradley in charge of the Goats after he quit to become the U.S. coach.\n","Preki went on to become Toronto’s fourth coach, leading the team to a 7-17-7 record in 2010 before he and Johnston, then director of soccer were fired that September.\n","——\n","Follow @NeilMDavidson on Twitter\n"," This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.
