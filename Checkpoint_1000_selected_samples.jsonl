It can also be used as a safe sleep space and has been awarded British Safety standard accreditation as a crib for use at home.\n\u201cWe will continue to listen to feedback as the Baby Box reaches more families and work with parents and healthcare professionals to keep the contents under review.\n\u201cThe national roll-out is the result of months of hard work and engagement with healthcare professionals, stakeholders and parents and I would like to thank everyone involved in helping us reach this momentous occasion.\n\u201cThe Baby Box has certainly captured the public\u2019s imagination and we are extremely proud to introduce it to Scotland.\u201d\nChief Medical Officer Dr Catherine Calderwood said: \u201cAll the evidence shows that the early years are crucial for children\u2019s development. What happens then can be linked to outcomes much later in life. So we know that measures undertaken in the 0-3 years age range have the opportunity to make the biggest impact.\n\u201cThat is why we have been working hard to enhance the existing infrastructure available to support families in these crucial early years from before birth all the way up to school age and beyond.\n\u201cOver and above the practical benefits the items within the Baby Box provide, the box itself also offers healthcare professionals a unique opportunity to introduce expectant parents to a wide range of health promotion information.\u201d\nAll babies due on or after 15 August will be eligible for a Baby Box.", "gold_summary": "All babies in Scotland due from tomorrow (August 15) will be gifted a Box full of essential items aimed at tackling inequality and promoting health.", "generated_summary": "  All babies in Scotland due from tomorrow (August 15) will be gifted a Box full of essential items aimed at tackling inequality and promoting health.", "rouge1": 1.0, "rouge2": 1.0, "rougeL": 1.0, "bertscore": [1.0], "bleu": 1.0, "meteor": 0.9999772230320699}
